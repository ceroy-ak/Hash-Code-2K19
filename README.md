# Hash Code 2019
2019 hashcode implementation


# Note:
```diff
- This is one of the worst implementation and will only give you a total of around 2,90,000 points. 
- So again I am requesting you all to not refer to it as a solution but only to refer to it 
- as "If we had done this, Then what would have happend" purpose
- The code is not using any multithreading so will easily take 4-5 hours to generate the output
```

# Then why posting this code?
Simple
To upload this and populate my GitHub. And also for those people who thought of the solution in the same as we did by using for loop as below
```python
    for i in range(N):
      for j in range(N):
        if same or similar tags then replace 
        the proceeding image with the same or similar tag ones
```        
Simply I want to tell those people, it won't work. Check the scores below
